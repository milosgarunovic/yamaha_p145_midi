# Yamaha P-145 MIDI

This is implementation of one feature that I need but isn't onboard of the piano. It's to enable and disable local control so I can use piano sounds from plugins, or synths, with the keyboard.

This is taken from the [manual](https://de.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/4/2144534/p145_en_mr_a0.pdf), page 4.

Without local control off, you would hear onboard piano sound and sound from vst.

The code is generated from chatgpt, I just needed it to work, I didn't look too much into it. It does not communicate with any server, so you can open html in the browser and use it.
